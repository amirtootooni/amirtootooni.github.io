    <h1>Favorite fruits</h1>
<p>10 Jun 2021 - Amir</p>

<p>Like my late grandfather, I eat a lot of fruits. Maybe about 500g every day.</p>

<p>If I were to list my favorite ones this would be my list (at the time of this post):</p>

<p><strong>Trier 1</strong>: pomegranates, nectarines, and donut peaches</p>

<p><strong>Trier 2</strong>: water melones, gala apples, gheisi (native to my hometown), and alooche (native to my home country)</p>

<p><strong>Trier 3</strong>:  all berries, kiwi fruits, melons, grapes, and pears</p>

<p><strong>Trier 4</strong>:  citrus fruits</p>

<p><strong>Trier 5</strong>: not worth mentioning</p>

<p><strong>Trier <em>don’t like</em></strong>: mangos</p>

<p>I think my grandfather would approve, I remember he really liked gheisi (a type of plum), but I remember sitting next to him and watching TV while he would peel all sort of fruits and veggies and eat them with me. He would peel and deseed pomegranates for me to eat as a snack. To this day I think that’s one of the kindest gestures for someone you love, peeling and deseeding pomegranates for them…</p>
