title: Peeling Bananas

Whenever I eat bananas nowadays, I peel from the head, not the stem. I do so subconsciously, because my friend Reza taught me about how this is way more efficient and said  _this is how it’s supposed to be done_. So I have followed his advice ever since grade 12. 

Once in a while some one points out that how I peel the banana is odd or I notice its oddity, but it always reminds me of my good friend Reza. I eat bananas quite frequently, so I’m reminded of my buddy every now and then no matter how busy I am or how long it’s been since our last conversation.
