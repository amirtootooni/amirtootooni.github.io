title: Heroes by Stephen Fry
type: book
---

The second entry in Stephen Fry's greek myth series, [Heroes](https://www.stephenfry.com/store/) is ancient greek stories reimagined by Stephen Fry.

I had no idea Stephen Fry was a writer, I knew him from [A Bit of Fry and Laurie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bit_of_Fry_%26_Laurie) and found him genuinely funny. His humor definitely comes through in the stories but more than that the book is fun to read. I think there might be an Audio version of this, knowing Stephen's familiarity with accents and acting chops I think it'll be a must-listen.

Many famous heroes (and many more I didn't know of) were told in Stephen's image. My favorite one was probably _Hercules_ or maybe _Perseus_. I mean they were all great. Hercules reminded me of Kratos, and Perseus is said to be an ancestor of the Persians, so I am biased in my opinion.
