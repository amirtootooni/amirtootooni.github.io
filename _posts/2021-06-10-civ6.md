I knew about Civ V in high school as a lot of my friends played it, I never really got into it for some reason. I had a friend in uni who introduced me to Civ VI and walked me through the rules and mechanics. It was quite intriguing and I started playing it a lot during the winter break.

One reason I really got hooked was how OP Cyrus is, now I'm all things Achaemenid Empire, so seeing the Immortal units and Cyrus' _Fall of Babylon_ perk made me super excited.

Maybe I've played 50 to 60 games at most an in at least 40 of them I played as Cyrus...

I haven't had much time recently to play though, I think the last time I played was December 2020.
