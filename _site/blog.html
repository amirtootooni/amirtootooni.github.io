    <h1>Some thoughts of mine</h1>

<ul>
  
    <li>
      <h2><a href="/2021/06/10/favorite-fruits.html">Favorite fruits</a></h2>
      <p>Like my late grandfather, I eat a lot of fruits. Maybe about 500g every day.</p>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <h2><a href="/2021/06/10/bananas.html">Bananas</a></h2>
      <p>Whenever I eat bananas nowadays, I peel from the head, not the stem. I do so unconsciously, because my friend Reza taught me about how this is way more efficient and said  <em>this is how itâ€™s supposed to be done</em>. So I have followed his advice ever since grade 12.</p>
