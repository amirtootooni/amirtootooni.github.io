title: Favorite Fruits
type: blog
---

Like my late grandfather, I eat a lot of fruits; maybe about 500g every day. 

If I were to list my favorite ones this would be my list (at the time of this post):

**Trier 1**: pomegranates, nectarines, and donut peaches

**Trier 2**: water melons, gala apples, gheisi (native to my hometown), and alooche (native to my home country)

**Trier 3**:  all berries, kiwi fruits, melons, grapes, and pears

**Trier 4**:  citrus fruits

**Trier 5**: not worth mentioning

 **Trier _don’t like_**: mangos 

I think my grandfather would approve, I remember he really liked gheisi (a type of plum), but I remember sitting next to him and watching TV while he would peel all sort of fruits and veggies and eat them with me. He would peel and _deseed_ pomegranates for me to eat as a snack. To this day I think that’s one of the kindest gestures for someone you love, peeling and _deseeding_ pomegranates for them...
