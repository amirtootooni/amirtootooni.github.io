I had the great privilege and pleasure of working with Prof. [Joel Friedman](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jf/) for my Master degree. 
My [thesis](/public/PDFs/thesis.pdf) (published [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0412871)) is culmination of my work over the past two years.
