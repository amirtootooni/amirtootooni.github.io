Hi there!

I'm a master's student in the [computer science department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [the university of british columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

I have the great privilege and absolute pleasure of working with (and being supervised by) Prof. [Joel Friedman](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jf/).

Currently, my research primarily involves abstract algebra and information theory. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in algebraic graph theory and expansion on graphs. Game theory and formal methods are other areas I like.

You can find my [resume](/public/PDFs/resume.pdf), [CV](public/PDFs/CV.pdf), and other stuff in the side bar. Just press &#9776; at the top left corner.
